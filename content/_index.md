title: "LP Relaxes"

Hi! I'm Linda. Lots of folks call me "LP," my grad school [nickname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation). 

I'm a Tech Lead for [epi-ENGAGE](https://www.cdc.gov/insight-net/php/implementers/index.html), working for [Dr. Lauren Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/LaurenM/index.html) in the [Integrative Biology](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/) department at UT Austin. epi-ENGAGE is [funded by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/insight-net/php/about/index.html) to implement scalable modeling and analytic tools for public health departments. One of my current projects involves leading development of the [city-level transmission modeling](https://lp-relaxation.github.io/CLT_BaseModel_Docs/) code base and mathematical framework. 

I studied mathematics (undergraduate) and operations research (masters and Ph.D.). I've been lucky to receive training from [Dr. Barry Nelson](https://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nelsonb/) and [Dr. Dave Morton](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/morton-david.html). My expertise includes optimization, stochastic simulation, statistics, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. 

I started this website to motivate myself to write more, both for myself (to think more deeply) and for others (to share knowledge and ideas).[^fn1] 

I like [board games](https://store.stonemaiergames.com/products/wingspan-oceania-expansion)[^fn2], [music](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/endlessness), [movies](https://www.thebeverlytheater.com/news/the-untold-story-of-le-samourai), sneakers, walking around, and coffee. These days I'm trying to become a [better cook](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/), work on my boxing footwork, and mend my own clothes.   

[^fn1]: My personal philosophy is that *playing and persuading* are crucial ways to learn something deeply. (Hm... can I trademark this?) And in my opinion, writing *is* persuasion -- I mean, step $0$ is to convince the reader that continuing to read is worth their time. 

[^fn2]: I think most board game rulebooks are written poorly. I think instruction manuals should *start with the win condition* and then move backwards, rather than starting with components and widgets. Context is everything: it's the difference between trying to memorize detailed mechanisms presented without motivation versus logically understanding decision spaces with respect to an objective function.
