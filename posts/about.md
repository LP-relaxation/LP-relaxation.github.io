# Currently

- Staying cozy with some jazz, both [old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy_fxxj1mMY) and [new](https://nalasinephro.com/?lang=en_GB) during rainy days.
- Adding some classic Western [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly) to my watch list. 
- Trying to conquer my fear of heights while top roping.
- Working on my left hook. 
- Requesting that board game explanations always start with the win condition and then work backwards (I think most rulebooks are written horribly).
- Enjoying [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova), [Dominion](https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion/), and [Baba is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/) with friends.
- Reading and writing about technical concepts in AI. 

# Recently

- Tested out some waterproof pants while hiking in the rain and show in [Yosemite](https://www.yosemite.com/top-winter-hikes/) (they're a game changer).
- Finished Huyen's ["AI Engineering,"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/) Tunstall et al.'s ["Natural Language Processing with Transformers,"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/) and Bhargava's ["Grokking Algorithms."](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms-second/9781633438538/)
